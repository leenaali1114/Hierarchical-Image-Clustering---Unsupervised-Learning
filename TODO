* use logging instead of print

* When calculating fingerprints: If fingerprints.pk is present, check for new
  image files and calculate for those only.

* Add option to main() for passing a global fingerprints.pk file, which gets
  updated. Remove hard-coded location
  /path/to/pics/imagecluster/fingerprints.pk

* We need an option to pass a list of file names to io.get_image_data(),
  examples/inria_holiday.sh (old select.sh) is just stooopid. In case we pass
  in file names, put db files in ./imagecluster/ by default. The end.
